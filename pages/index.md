Yo, I'm Qrexxed. A fullstack dev (mostly backend) who does programming as a hobby or therapy üôè.<br>

My most recently contribution was on {Stocks Predictor|https://github.com/unerrored/Stocks_Predictor}, I recommend you to check it out!<br>

I actually got into coding by movies, one of them which you can guess is &nbsp;<PeopleWithAvatar
 link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/"
 name="Mr Robot"
 avatarUrl="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/37/17/d6/3717d6a414d8dc80186aa48cbd089804.jpg"
/>, literally an inspiring movie, I then started to take Python courses to learn more. The rest of my experience is either from past scripts I read or something I learned recently. I would probably be interested in learning {C++|https://cplusplus.com/} or {C#|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/} in the future!

I don't do anything else from programming. Probably going outside sometimes with my friends and my family. I'm not used much to the outside world.
